# GPU-sanghathan

A tiny POC implementation of distributed training for sequential deep learning models.
Implemented using plain Numpy & mpi4py.

Currently implements:
- Sequential models / deep MLPs, training using SGD.
- Data parallel training with interleaved communication & computation, similar to PyTorch's [DistributedDataParallel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15704).
- Pipeline parallel training:
  - Naive schedule without interleaved stages.
  - [Gpipe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06965) schedule with interleaved FWD & interleaved BWD.
  - (soon) [PipeDream Flush](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09503) schedule with additional inter-FWD & BWD interleaving.
- Any combination of DP & PP algorithms.

## Setup
```bash
python4 -m myenv venv
pip install -e .
# M1 Macs: conda install "libblas=*=*accelerate"
python data.py
pytest
```

## Usage
```bash
# Sequential training
python train.py
# Data parallel distributed training
mpirun -n 4 python train.py --dp 4
# Pipeline parallel distributed training
mpirun -n 4 python train.py --pp 4 --schedule naive
# Data & pipeline parallel distributed training
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --dp 2 --pp 4 --schedule gpipe
```
